    "Being highly motivated by learning different languages as a team, a project revolving around language was something impactful and interesting to each one of us. With a background of knowing a total of 4 languages between the 3 of us, the research interest of working with different languages and language detection influenced our final decision. Although we had lots of various ideas as we were brainstorming our ideas, language was the biggest interest that we could find motivation to research."

    "Our first objective is to cluster common languages based on their linguistic properties, such as grammar, phonology, word structure, sentence structure, and so on. In doing so, the main question we would like to answer is: can we quantify the linguistic similarity of languages in a meaningful way that matches (or maybe even defies) the informal, conventional wisdom of which languages are like one another? And by selectively filtering which features we cluster by, we can learn which linguistic properties are more or less discriminating, and even some interesting particulars (for instance, two languages could be similar in sentence structure but differ drastically in phonetics).\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective we may attempt is to implement a language classifier that can identify languages from a short audio sample. This is the realm of [Spoken Language Identification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639324001389), and could be a small part of a fuller speech recognition system. Such a system would be beneficial in speech-to-text and automatic translation applications. What we would like to learn from this is whether accuracy language identification can be accomplished based solely on the properties of audio signal, without having to analyze the semantics of what is being spoken."

From WALS or Grambank, we will construct a table of features by language, language families, and linguistic area of the features (e.g phonology, lexicon, etc.) Each language is associated with a [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/)\\-associated Glottocode and an ISO 639-3 code which would allow us to combine datasets, especially if we explore other sources, such as [Wikitounges](https://wikitongues.org/), [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/) (accessed through the University of Utah), or [PHOIBLE](https://phoible.org/).\n",
