##### Project Title:

> **Microeconomic Analysis of Wheat Pricing and Market Behavior in Kansas**

### Feedback from them to us:

- Need project name
- Consider looking at decision trees and k-NN models models to predict language families
- Could Altaic be a family?
- Are there unrelated languages with very common features?
- We could do clustering to find anomaliesâ€”languages whose features are significantly different from others in its family
- Idea seems good; need to acquire some sample data first to present more clearly the structure of the data that we will be analyzing, and what concrete steps we will take for the analysis

### Feedback from us to them:

- They will analyze wheat prices in Kansas and environmental factors
- Where does the weather data come from?
- Overall, they look like they have a solid plan for data acquisition (already acquired some data and peformed some preliminary data exploration) as well as analysis methodologies (time series analysis via ARIMA and regression analysis and classification)
- One recommendation would be to expound what data visualization methods they expect to employ
